# 🍳 Beyond Recipes

**Beyond Recipes** is a simple React web app that helps users discover new and exciting recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home.  
Type in a few ingredients (like “tomatoes, eggs, cheese”) and the app suggests real recipes you can prepare using those items — fetched live from the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).
